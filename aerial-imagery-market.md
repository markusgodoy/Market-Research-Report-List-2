<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aerial Imagery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Oblique Imagery</li><li>High Oblique Imagery</li><li>Vertical Imagery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Low Oblique Imagery is captured at an angle from the ground, typically at a 30-60 degree angle, providing a more three-dimensional perspective. High Oblique Imagery is taken at a steeper angle, around 60-80 degrees, offering a wider view of an area while still showing the horizon. Vertical Imagery is captured directly from above, creating a flat, bird's eye view of the area. These different types of aerial imagery serve various purposes in industries such as urban planning, agriculture, environmental monitoring, and disaster response.</p></p>
