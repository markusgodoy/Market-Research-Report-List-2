<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aprotic Solvents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dipolar Aprotic Solvent</li><li>Inert Solvent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aprotic solvents are classified into two main types - dipolar aprotic solvents and inert solvents. Dipolar aprotic solvents, such as DMF and DMSO, have a high polarity due to their strong dipole moment, making them excellent for solubilizing polar compounds. In contrast, inert solvents like hexane and toluene have low polarity and are used for non-polar reactions. Both types of aprotic solvents play essential roles in various industries like pharmaceuticals, electronics, and chemicals due to their unique properties and versatility in different reactions.</p></p>
