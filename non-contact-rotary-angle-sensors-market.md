<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non contact Rotary Angle Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Outputs</li><li>Dual Outputs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-contact rotary angle sensors can be categorized into two main types: single output and dual output sensors. Single output sensors provide only one output signal that represents the angle of rotation, making them simpler and more cost-effective. On the other hand, dual output sensors offer two separate output signals, providing redundancy and greater accuracy. This redundancy allows for more reliable measurements and higher precision in demanding applications. Both types of sensors have their advantages and are used in various industries depending on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
