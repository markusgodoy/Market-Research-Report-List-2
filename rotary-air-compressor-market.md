<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Air Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oiled Rotary Air Compressor</li><li>Oil-free Rotary Air Compressor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary air compressors can be categorized into two main types: Oiled Rotary Air Compressors and Oil-free Rotary Air Compressors. Oiled rotary air compressors use oil for lubrication and cooling, which can potentially contaminate the compressed air. On the other hand, oil-free rotary air compressors do not require oil lubrication, resulting in cleaner compressed air suitable for sensitive applications like medical devices and food processing. Both types of compressors have their unique advantages and are used in various industries based on specific requirements.</p></p>
