<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyvinylidene Chloride (PVDC) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Isotactic</li><li>Atactic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PVDC is a versatile polymer used for packaging due to its barrier properties. It can be classified into two main types based on the arrangement of its molecular structure - isotactic and atactic. Isotactic PVDC has a highly ordered molecular structure, resulting in strong barrier properties, while atactic PVDC has a more random arrangement, leading to lower barrier properties. Isotactic PVDC is preferred for applications requiring high barrier to gases and vapors, while atactic PVDC is used for less stringent barrier requirements.</p></p>
