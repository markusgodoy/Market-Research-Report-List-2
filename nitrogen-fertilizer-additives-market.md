<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitrogen Fertilizer Additives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Urease Inhibitors Based Nitrogen Fertilizer Additives</li><li>Nitrification Inhibitor Based Nitrogen Fertilizer Additives</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Nitrogen fertilizer additives are used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of nitrogen fertilizers. Two common types of additives are urease inhibitors and nitrification inhibitors. Urease inhibitors prevent the breakdown of urea into ammonia, reducing nitrogen loss through volatilization. Nitrification inhibitors slow down the conversion of ammonium to nitrate, reducing nitrogen leaching and denitrification. These additives help increase the availability of nitrogen to plants, leading to better yields and reduced environmental impact.</p></p>
