<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Orbital Weld Heads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Enclosed</li><li>Clamp-On</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Orbital Weld Heads are segmented into two main types: Enclosed and Clamp-On. Enclosed weld heads are designed to provide a controlled environment for welding, protecting the weld from any external factors that could compromise its integrity. On the other hand, Clamp-On weld heads are more versatile, as they can be easily attached to different types of pipes or tubes for welding. Both types of weld heads are commonly used in industries where high precision and quality welds are required, such as pharmaceutical, food and beverage, and semiconductor industries.</p></p>
