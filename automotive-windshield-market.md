<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Windshield Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laminated Glass</li><li>Tempered Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive windshield market consists of two main types: laminated glass and tempered glass. Laminated glass is made by sandwiching a layer of PVB between two layers of glass, offering durability and safety by preventing the glass from shattering on impact. Tempered glass is created through a process of extreme heating and rapid cooling, making it stronger than regular glass but when broken, it shatters into tiny pieces to prevent injuries. Both types offer different levels of protection and safety for vehicle occupants.</p></p>
