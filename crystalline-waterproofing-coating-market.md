<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crystalline Waterproofing Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cement-based Permeable Crystalline Waterproof Coating</li><li>Water-based Permeable Crystalline Waterproof Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Crystalline waterproofing coatings are divided into two main types: cement-based permeable crystalline waterproof coatings and water-based permeable crystalline waterproof coatings. </p><p>Cement-based coatings are made from a cementitious material that forms crystals within the pores of the concrete, creating a barrier against water penetration. </p><p>Water-based coatings use a similar crystalline technology but are applied as a liquid, allowing them to penetrate deeper into the concrete substrate. Both types of coatings provide long-lasting protection against water damage and are commonly used in construction and building maintenance applications.</p></p>
