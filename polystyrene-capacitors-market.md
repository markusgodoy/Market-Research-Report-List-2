<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polystyrene Capacitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Polystyrene Capacitors</li><li>Radial Polystyrene Capacitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polystyrene capacitors are classified into two main types: Axial Polystyrene Capacitors and Radial Polystyrene Capacitors. Axial Polystyrene Capacitors have their leads coming out from opposite ends of the capacitor body, making them suitable for applications requiring precise and stable capacitance values. Radial Polystyrene Capacitors have their leads coming out from the same side of the capacitor body, making them more space-efficient and easy to install on circuit boards. Both types of capacitors offer low dielectric loss, high insulation resistance, and excellent stability over a wide temperature range.</p></p>
