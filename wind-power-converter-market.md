<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wind Power Converter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double-fed converter</li><li>Full-power converter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Double-fed converter technology in the wind power converter market utilizes a partially rated power converter with both grid-side and rotor-side converters, allowing for variable speed operation. This type of converter is typically less expensive than full-power converters, making it an attractive option for smaller wind turbines. On the other hand, full-power converters offer higher efficiency and better grid compatibility due to their ability to completely control the power flow. This technology is often used in larger, utility-scale wind turbines.</p></p>
