<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shrinkage-Reducing Admixture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polyethers</li><li>Polyalcohol</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Shrinkage-reducing admixtures are commonly categorized into three main types: polyethers, polyalcohols, and others. Polyethers are synthetic polymers that help to reduce the surface tension of water, resulting in lower shrinkage in concrete. Polyalcohols, on the other hand, work by absorbing excess water in the concrete mixture, thus reducing shrinkage. Other types of shrinkage-reducing admixtures may include various chemical compounds designed to control the hydration process and minimize cracking in concrete structures. Each type offers unique benefits in mitigating shrinkage issues in construction projects.</p></p>
