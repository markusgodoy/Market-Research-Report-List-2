<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hybrid Cars Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Series Hybrid</li><li>Parallel Hybrid</li><li>Plug-in Hybrid</li><li>Series-Parallel Hybrid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hybrid cars come in four main market types: Series Hybrid, Parallel Hybrid, Plug-in Hybrid, and Series-Parallel Hybrid. In a Series Hybrid, the internal combustion engine only powers a generator, which charges the battery and powers the electric motor that propels the vehicle. In a Parallel Hybrid, both the internal combustion engine and electric motor can power the vehicle simultaneously. A Plug-in Hybrid can be charged from an external power source in addition to using regenerative braking. A Series-Parallel Hybrid combines elements of both Series and Parallel systems for improved efficiency.</p></p>
