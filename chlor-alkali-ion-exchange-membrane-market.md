<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chlor-alkali Ion Exchange Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Membrane with Sacrificial Thread</li><li>Membrane without Sacrificial Thread</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chlor-alkali ion exchange membranes are used in electrochemical processes for the production of chlorine and alkali. Membranes with sacrificial thread are designed with an additional thread that sacrificially deteriorates over time, extending the membrane's lifespan. On the other hand, membranes without sacrificial thread do not have this additional feature. Both types of membranes serve the same purpose of separating the anolyte and catholyte compartments, allowing for efficient production of chlorine and alkali.</p></p>
