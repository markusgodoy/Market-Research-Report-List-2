<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Botanical Native Pesticide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Phytotoxin</li><li>Phytogenous Insect Hormone</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Botanical native pesticides can be classified into two main types - phytotoxin and phytogenous insect hormone. Phytotoxins are natural plant compounds that are toxic to other plants, acting as a form of chemical warfare to inhibit the growth and development of competing vegetation. On the other hand, phytogenous insect hormones are compounds produced by plants that mimic insect hormones, disrupting their growth and reproduction. Both types of pesticides exploit the natural chemical defenses of plants to control pest populations in an environmentally-friendly manner.</p></p>
