<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dispersing Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-Molecular-Weight</li><li>Low-Molecular-Weight</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dispersing agents are classified into two main types based on their molecular weight: high-molecular-weight dispersing agents and low-molecular-weight dispersing agents. High-molecular-weight dispersing agents are typically polymers with long chains that increase the stability of the dispersion by forming a protective layer around particles. On the other hand, low-molecular-weight dispersing agents are smaller molecules that have a higher affinity for the particle surface, leading to improved dispersion and stability. Both types play a crucial role in various industries such as paints, coatings, and adhesives.</p></p>
